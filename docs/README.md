# üìä Kamal Singh Portfolio - C4 Architecture Diagrams

This directory contains comprehensive C4 diagrams documenting the architecture of the Kamal Singh Portfolio application.

## üéØ C4 Model Overview

The C4 model provides a hierarchical way to think about and document software architecture:

- **Level 1: Context** - How the system fits into the world
- **Level 2: Containers** - High-level technology choices and responsibilities  
- **Level 3: Components** - Components within containers
- **Level 4: Code** - Implementation details (classes, functions)

## üìÅ Available Diagrams

### üåç [System Context Diagram](c4-context-diagram.puml)
**Level 1** - Shows the portfolio system in relation to users and external systems.

**Key Elements:**
- Portfolio visitors (potential clients, recruiters)
- Kamal Singh (portfolio owner)
- External email servers (Gmail, Outlook)
- GitHub repository and Docker registries
- Web browsers

### üèóÔ∏è [Container Diagram](c4-container-diagram.puml) 
**Level 2** - Shows the main containers and technology choices.

**Key Containers:**
- **Nginx** - Web server, SSL termination, reverse proxy
- **React Frontend** - Portfolio website with responsive design
- **FastAPI Backend** - REST API with email functionality
- **MongoDB** - Document database
- **Email Service** - SMTP integration with templates

### üîß [Backend Component Diagram](c4-component-backend.puml)
**Level 3** - Detailed view of FastAPI backend components.

**Key Components:**
- API Router with CORS middleware
- Contact, Health, and Status controllers
- Email service with template rendering
- Database client with async operations
- Pydantic validation models
- Background task processing

### üé® [Frontend Component Diagram](c4-component-frontend.puml)
**Level 3** - Detailed view of React frontend components.

**Key Components:**
- App component with routing
- Page components (Home, About, Projects, Contact)
- Enhanced contact form with validation
- Project showcase with filtering
- UI components (Shadcn/UI)
- Contact service (API integration)

### üöÄ [Deployment Diagram](c4-deployment-diagram.puml)
**Infrastructure** - Shows deployment options and environments.

**Deployment Options:**
- **Single Container**: All services in one Docker container
- **Multi-Container**: Separate containers with Docker Compose
- **Cloud Deployment**: AWS, GCP, Azure options
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions with automated builds

### üìä [Data Flow Diagram](c4-data-flow-diagram.puml)
**Process Flow** - Shows how contact form data flows through the system.

**Flow Steps:**
1. Form submission with validation
2. Rate limiting and security checks
3. Database storage
4. Background email processing
5. SMTP delivery to recipient and auto-reply

### üõ†Ô∏è [Technology Stack Diagram](c4-technology-stack.puml)
**Technology Overview** - Complete technology stack with relationships.

**Technology Categories:**
- Frontend: React 19, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn/UI
- Backend: Python 3.11, FastAPI, MongoDB
- Infrastructure: Docker, Nginx, Ubuntu
- DevOps: GitHub Actions, Container Registries
- Email: SMTP integration, HTML templates

## üé® Rendering the Diagrams

sudo apt-get install plantuml

# Render diagrams
plantuml docs/*.puml

# Or render specific diagram
plantuml docs/c4-context-diagram.puml
```

### VS Code Integration
```bash
# Install PlantUML extension
code --install-extension plantuml

# Preview in VS Code
# Open .puml file and press Alt+D
```

## üìã Architecture Highlights

### üéØ **Key Architectural Decisions**

#### **Single Container vs Multi-Container**
- **Single Container**: Easier deployment, all services managed together
- **Multi-Container**: Better separation of concerns, independent scaling

#### **Technology Choices**
- **React 19**: Modern frontend with hooks and concurrent features
- **FastAPI**: High-performance Python API with automatic documentation
- **MongoDB**: Flexible document database for portfolio content
- **Nginx**: Production-ready web server with security features

#### **Security Features**
- Rate limiting (10 req/min API, 3 req/min contact form)
- Input validation with Pydantic models
- CORS configuration for controlled access
- SSL/TLS encryption with self-signed certificates
- Security headers (HSTS, CSP, XSS protection)

#### **Email Integration**
- Professional HTML email templates
- Auto-reply functionality for user experience
- Multiple SMTP provider support (Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo)
- Rate limiting to prevent spam (10 emails/hour)
- Background processing for non-blocking operations

### üöÄ **Scalability & Performance**

#### **Frontend Optimizations**
- Static asset caching with aggressive cache headers
- Gzip compression for reduced bandwidth
- Lazy loading for improved initial load times
- Responsive design for mobile performance

#### **Backend Optimizations**
- Async/await throughout for high concurrency
- Connection pooling for database efficiency
- Background tasks for email processing
- Health checks for monitoring and reliability

#### **Database Design**
- Document-based schema for flexibility
- Indexes on frequently queried fields
- Schema validation for data integrity
- Async operations for better performance
