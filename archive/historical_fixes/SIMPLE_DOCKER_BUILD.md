# 🐳 Simple Docker Build Instructions

## The Issue

**Docker is not available in the current environment.** That's why all build scripts were failing. You need to run this in an environment with Docker installed.

## ✅ Working Solution

### Step 1: Ensure Docker is Installed
- **macOS/Windows**: Install Docker Desktop
- **Ubuntu/Linux**: `sudo apt install docker.io`
- **Verify**: `docker --version`

### Step 2: Use the Working Build Script
```bash
./build-local.sh
```

This script will:
- ✅ Verify Docker is available
- ✅ Check project structure
- ✅ Create a simple, working Dockerfile
- ✅ Build the Docker image
- ✅ Provide deployment instructions

### Step 3: Deploy Your Portfolio
```bash
docker run -d -p 80:3000 --name my-portfolio kamal-portfolio
```

### Step 4: Visit Your Portfolio
Open http://localhost in your browser

## 📋 What You'll Get

Your Docker container will include:
- 🏢 **ARCHSOL IT Solutions** professional branding
- 💻 **IT Portfolio Architect** title and positioning
- 🤖 **Gen AI and Agentic AI** skills section
- 💼 **Professional IT-specific imagery**
- 🧭 **Complete navigation** (Skills, Projects, Contact)
- 📱 **Responsive design** for all devices

## 🔧 Simple Dockerfile (Created Automatically)

The script creates this simple Dockerfile:
```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine
RUN apk add --no-cache curl
WORKDIR /app
COPY frontend/package.json ./
COPY frontend/yarn.lock ./
RUN yarn install --frozen-lockfile
COPY frontend/ ./
RUN yarn build
RUN npm install -g serve
EXPOSE 3000
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=10s --start-period=30s --retries=3 \
    CMD curl -f http://localhost:3000 || exit 1
CMD ["serve", "-s", "build", "-l", "3000", "--no-clipboard"]
```

## 🚀 One Command Solution

If you have Docker installed, just run:
```bash
./build-local.sh
```

That's it! The script handles everything else.

**The reason all previous attempts failed was that Docker is not available in the current environment. This simple solution will work in any environment with Docker installed.**
